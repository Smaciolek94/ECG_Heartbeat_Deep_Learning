# ECG_Heartbeat_Deep_Learning
Using Nueral Nets and Possibly other ML methods to model ECG data

Data is here:
https://www.kaggle.com/shayanfazeli/heartbeat?select=mitbih_test.csv

look into SMOTE because the data are highly imbalanced, use imbalanced-Learn data

look at 2D vs 1D conv nets

Look at dropout(p) 0 < p < 1 and regularization

ptb is binary

mit is multinomial
